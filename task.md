  In this stage, you'll implement the pwd builtin.                            
                                                                              
  ### The pwd Builtin                                                         
                                                                              
  The pwd https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pwd (print working directory) builtin 
  prints the full, absolute path of the current working directory to stdout.  
                                                                              
  When your shell starts, its current working directory is typically the      
  directory from which it was executed. Your pwd implementation needs to      
  retrieve this information from the operating system and print it.           
                                                                              
  For example:                                                                
                                                                              
    $ pwd                                                                     
    /home/user/projects                                                       
    $ pwd                                                                     
    /usr/local/bin                                                            
                                                                              
  ### Tests                                                                   
                                                                              
  The tester will execute your program like this:                             
                                                                              
    ./your_program.sh                                                         
                                                                              
  It will then send a pwd command to your shell:                              
                                                                              
    $ pwd                                                                     
    /path/to/current/directory                                                
    $                                                                         
                                                                              
  The tester will verify that the pwd command correctly displays the current  
  working directory.                                                          
                                                                              
  ### Notes                                                                   
                                                                              
  • The pwd command must print the full absolute path of the current working  
  directory.
